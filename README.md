# WitcherPhpFramework
<h3>Witcher is an unofficial Framework in PHP coded by me. I decided to create my own Framework using raw PHP, so it uses few libraries such as default libraries of PHP and some plug-ins that are specific to projects.<h3>

- It uses the MVC software architecture (Model, View, Controller).<br>
- It is compatible with PHP 7.0 or higher.<br>
